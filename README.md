## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

  

### What I learned

I managed to get a better understanding of flexbox, I know it's simple but very valid challenge to get practice with flexbox.

### Continued development

I intend to gradually continue to better understand flexbox and Grid, which are tools that can be very tricky.
